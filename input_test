resize_factor = 12  % how much to rescale image at beginning
boxsize = 500  % expected pixels for Relion boxes/particles
winSize = 96 % pixels slightly smaller than fibril width 
convlength = 1080 % pixels length for thin rectangle convolution 
grid_edge = 0.3 % threshold for sobel edge detection of grid
ignore_sm = 28800  % area size in pixels to ignore (not try to fit fibril segment)
T = 0.5            % threshold for binary image
maskT = 0.75	% threshold for mask
winDelta = 24	% "vesselness" is checked for winSize +- winDelta5
