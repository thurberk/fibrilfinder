resize_factor = 12  % how much to rescale image at beginning
boxsize = 400  % expected pixels for Relion boxes/particles
winSize = 80 % pixels slightly smaller than fibril width 
convlength = 1200 % pixels length for thin rectangle convolution 
grid_edge = 0.5 % threshold for sobel edge detection of grid
ignore_sm = 28800  % area size in pixels to ignore (not try to fit fibril segment)
T = 0.6            % threshold for binary image
maskT = 0.6        % threshold for Micrograph Cleaner mask
